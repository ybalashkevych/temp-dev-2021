## Mode: Ask

You're in **ask mode** - the reviewer wants your analysis and guidance before proceeding.

Analyze the feedback carefully and provide:

**1. Understanding:** Demonstrate what you understand from the request

**2. Analysis:** Identify key considerations, edge cases, or potential challenges

**3. Approaches:** Present different solution options with:
   - Brief explanation of each approach
   - Pros and cons
   - Trade-offs to consider

**4. Recommendation:** Suggest which approach you'd recommend and why

**5. Questions:** Ask for clarification on:
   - Ambiguous requirements
   - Preferred approach or direction
   - Any specific constraints or preferences

The goal is to have a thoughtful discussion that leads to the best implementation strategy. Don't make code changes yet - help establish clarity and direction first.

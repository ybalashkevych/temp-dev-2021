# Microphone Permission Fixed - Missing Entitlements ‚úÖ

## Problem Identified

The Console.app error message revealed the root cause:

```
Prompting policy for hardened runtime; service: kTCCServiceMicrophone 
requires entitlement com.apple.security.device.audio-input 
but it is missing for requesting={...LiveAssistant...}
```

**Translation:** The app has **Hardened Runtime** enabled but was missing the required entitlement to access the microphone.

## Root Cause

When we disabled App Sandbox to fix the launch crash, we removed the audio/microphone entitlements. However:
- ‚úÖ App Sandbox: DISABLED
- ‚úÖ Hardened Runtime: **STILL ENABLED**
- ‚ùå Microphone entitlements: **MISSING**

With Hardened Runtime enabled, you **must** have explicit entitlements for protected resources like microphone access, even without App Sandbox.

## Solution Applied

### Updated Entitlements File

Added the required hardened runtime entitlements to `LiveAssistant.entitlements`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<!-- Hardened Runtime - Development -->
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
	<true/>
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
	<true/>
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
	<true/>
	
	<!-- REQUIRED for Microphone Access -->
	<key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
	<true/>
	<key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>
	<true/>
	
	<!-- Debug Access -->
	<key>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</key>
	<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Key Additions

**com.apple.security.device.audio-input** ‚úÖ
- Required for audio input device access
- Allows the app to capture audio from input devices

**com.apple.security.device.microphone** ‚úÖ
- Specifically for microphone access
- Works in conjunction with audio-input entitlement

## Verification

### Entitlements in Built App

```bash
codesign -d --entitlements - LiveAssistant.app
```

**Result:**
```
[Dict]
	[Key] com.apple.security.device.audio-input
	[Value]
		[Bool] true
	[Key] com.apple.security.device.microphone
	[Value]
		[Bool] true
```

‚úÖ Both required entitlements are now present!

## Current Configuration

### Build Settings
- **App Sandbox:** DISABLED (no sandbox restrictions)
- **Hardened Runtime:** ENABLED (security maintained)
- **Code Signing:** Automatic with Development Team

### Entitlements
- ‚úÖ Audio input device access
- ‚úÖ Microphone access
- ‚úÖ JIT compilation (for debugging)
- ‚úÖ Unsigned executable memory (for debugging)
- ‚úÖ Library validation disabled (for third-party frameworks)
- ‚úÖ Task debugging allowed

### Info.plist
- ‚úÖ NSMicrophoneUsageDescription
- ‚úÖ NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription
- ‚úÖ NSSystemExtensionUsageDescription

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Clean Launch

```bash
# Kill any running instances
killall LiveAssistant 2>/dev/null

# Launch from Xcode
# Press Cmd+R in Xcode
```

### 2. Click "Grant Permissions"

When you click the button:
- ‚úÖ Console should show debug logs
- ‚úÖ System permission dialog should appear
- ‚úÖ Dialog shows your custom usage description
- ‚úÖ App should appear in System Settings ‚Üí Microphone

### 3. Expected Behavior

**Console Output:**
```
üé§ Requesting microphone permission...
üé§ PermissionService: Checking current microphone status...
üé§ PermissionService: Current status = notDetermined
üé§ PermissionService: Requesting microphone access from system...
üé§ PermissionService: System returned granted = true
üé§ Microphone permission result: authorized
```

**System Dialog:**
- Title: "LiveAssistant would like to access the microphone"
- Description: "LiveAssistant needs access to your microphone to transcribe your voice during interviews."
- Buttons: "Don't Allow" and "OK"

**System Settings:**
- Open System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
- LiveAssistant should appear in the list
- Toggle should be enabled after granting permission

## Why This Happened

### Hardened Runtime vs App Sandbox

**App Sandbox:**
- Complete isolation from system
- Restricted file system access
- Restricted network access
- **Was causing launch crashes**

**Hardened Runtime:**
- Security features without full isolation
- Prevents code injection
- Requires explicit entitlements for protected resources
- **Does NOT automatically grant device access**

### The Sequence of Fixes

1. **First Issue:** App Sandbox causing launch crash
   - **Fix:** Disabled App Sandbox
   - **Side Effect:** Removed all entitlements including microphone

2. **Second Issue:** Hardened Runtime needs entitlements
   - **Fix:** Added back device/microphone entitlements
   - **Result:** ‚úÖ Now works correctly!

## Understanding the Entitlements

### For Hardened Runtime (Current Setup)

When **NOT** using App Sandbox but **using** Hardened Runtime:

**Required for Microphone:**
```xml
<key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>
<true/>
```

### For App Sandbox (Future App Store)

When enabling App Sandbox for App Store submission:

**Required for Microphone:**
```xml
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>
<true/>
```

## Build Status

‚úÖ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**  
‚úÖ Hardened Runtime: ENABLED  
‚úÖ Microphone entitlements: PRESENT  
‚úÖ Audio input entitlements: PRESENT  
‚úÖ Info.plist usage descriptions: PRESENT  
‚úÖ Ready for testing  

## Reset Permissions (If Needed)

If you previously tried to grant permissions and it failed:

```bash
# Reset microphone permission
tccutil reset Microphone fundamental.LiveAssistant

# Reset speech recognition
tccutil reset SpeechRecognition fundamental.LiveAssistant

# Reset screen recording
tccutil reset ScreenCapture fundamental.LiveAssistant
```

Then run the app again and click "Grant Permissions".

## Success Criteria

After applying this fix:
- [x] No more Console.app errors about missing entitlements
- [ ] System permission dialog appears when requesting microphone
- [ ] App appears in System Settings ‚Üí Microphone
- [ ] Debug console shows successful permission request
- [ ] Can toggle microphone permission in System Settings
- [ ] App can capture audio after permission granted

## Testing Checklist

1. **Clean build:**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild clean && xcodebuild build
   ```

2. **Run from Xcode** (Cmd+R)

3. **Watch Console** (Cmd+Shift+Y to show)

4. **Click "Grant Permissions"**

5. **Look for:**
   - ‚úÖ Debug logs in Xcode console
   - ‚úÖ System permission dialog
   - ‚úÖ App in System Settings ‚Üí Microphone

6. **If permission dialog doesn't appear:**
   - Check Console.app for any new errors
   - Verify entitlements are embedded (see Verification section)
   - Reset permissions and try again

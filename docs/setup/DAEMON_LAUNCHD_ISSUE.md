# Daemon launchd Issue & Solution

**Status:** Daemon works perfectly when run manually, but fails with exit code 78 (EX_CONFIG) when run via launchd.

## Problem Description

The `cursor-daemon.sh` script exits immediately with code 78 (EX_CONFIG) when started by launchd, even though:

✅ The script runs perfectly when executed manually  
✅ All prerequisites are met (gh, git, authentication)  
✅ The plist configuration is valid  
✅ Environment variables are properly set  
✅ The wrapper script is executable  

Exit code 78 suggests a configuration error, but this appears to be a macOS security/sandboxing restriction rather than an actual script configuration issue.

## Changes Made to Improve Compatibility

### 1. Removed `set -e` from daemon script
**Why:** Prevents the script from exiting on non-critical errors (like jq not being installed).

### 2. Made jq optional
**Why:** Attempting to install jq via `brew install` from launchd context fails and causes exit.

### 3. Created wrapper script
**File:** `scripts/cursor-daemon-wrapper.sh`  
**Why:** Ensures proper environment setup (PATH, HOME, working directory) before starting daemon.

### 4. Added extensive debugging
- Debug logs to `/tmp/cursor-daemon-debug.log`
- Wrapper logs to `/tmp/cursor-daemon-wrapper.log`
- Better error handling throughout

### 5. Updated launchd plist
- Added explicit HOME environment variable
- Updated to use wrapper script instead of direct daemon execution
- Maintained all necessary paths and redirections

## Current Status

**Manual Execution:** ✅ Works perfectly
```bash
cd /Users/yurii/Desktop/Projects/LiveAssistant
./scripts/cursor-daemon.sh
```

**launchd Execution:** ❌ Exits with code 78

## Recommended Solution: Manual Startup

Until the launchd issue is resolved, run the daemon manually:

### Option 1: Foreground (see output)
```bash
cd /Users/yurii/Desktop/Projects/LiveAssistant
./scripts/cursor-daemon.sh
```

### Option 2: Background (daemon mode)
```bash
cd /Users/yurii/Desktop/Projects/LiveAssistant
nohup ./scripts/cursor-daemon.sh > logs/cursor-daemon.log 2>&1 &
```

### Option 3: Using wrapper
```bash
cd /Users/yurii/Desktop/Projects/LiveAssistant
./scripts/cursor-daemon-wrapper.sh &
```

## Verification

After starting manually, verify it's running:
```bash
ps aux | grep cursor-daemon | grep -v grep
tail -f logs/cursor-daemon.log  # Watch logs in real-time
```

## Future Investigation

Potential causes to investigate:

1. **TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) Permissions**
   - Terminal may need Full Disk Access
   - GitHub CLI might need special permissions when run via launchd

2. **Code Signing**
   - Scripts might need to be code-signed for launchd execution

3. **Sandbox Restrictions**
   - launchd runs with different security context
   - May need additional entitlements or permissions

4. **Keychain Access**
   - `gh auth` uses keychain which might not be accessible from launchd context
   - Could try using GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable instead

## Tested Configurations

| Configuration | Result |
|--------------|--------|
| Direct script execution | ✅ Works |
| Script with bash -x debug | ✅ Works |
| Wrapper script manual | ✅ Works |
| launchd with direct script | ❌ Exit 78 |
| launchd with wrapper script | ❌ Exit 78 |
| launchd with explicit environment | ❌ Exit 78 |

## Conclusion

**The daemon functionality is verified and working.** The launchd integration issue appears to be related to macOS security restrictions rather than script problems.

**Recommendation:** Use manual startup (Option 2 above) for development. The daemon runs reliably and performs all monitoring functions correctly.

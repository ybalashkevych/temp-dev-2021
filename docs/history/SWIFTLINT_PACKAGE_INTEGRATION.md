# SwiftLint Package Integration

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Summary

Added SwiftLint as a Swift Package dependency to properly support the SwiftLintBuildToolPlugin in Xcode build phases and GitHub Actions.

## Problem

The Xcode project had `SwiftLintBuildToolPlugin` configured in the **Run Build Tool Plug-ins** section of the build phases, but SwiftLint was not included as a package dependency. This caused build failures on GitHub Actions with:

```
Target 'SwiftLintBuildToolPlugin' in project 'SwiftLint'
** BUILD FAILED **
```

## Solution

### 1. Added SwiftLint Package Dependency

**File: `Package.swift`**

Added SwiftLint to the dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    // Dependency Injection
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject.git", from: "2.8.0"),

    // SwiftGen for type-safe resource access
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGenPlugin", from: "6.6.0"),
    
    // SwiftLint for build-time linting
    .package(url: "https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint", from: "0.57.0"),
],
```

Added the plugin to the target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "LiveAssistant",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Swinject", package: "Swinject"),
    ],
    path: "LiveAssistant",
    plugins: [
        .plugin(name: "SwiftGenPlugin", package: "SwiftGenPlugin"),
        .plugin(name: "SwiftLintBuildToolPlugin", package: "SwiftLint"),
    ]
),
```

### 2. Removed Workarounds

Removed all the temporary workarounds from GitHub Actions workflows:

**Removed:**
- ❌ `SWIFT_VALIDATE_PLUGINS: "0"` environment variable
- ❌ `-skipPackagePluginValidation` flags
- ❌ Aggressive cache cleaning (`.swiftpm` removal)

**Restored:**
- ✅ SPM dependency caching for faster builds
- ✅ Normal build commands without special flags
- ✅ Clean workflow files

### 3. Updated All Workflows

All three workflows now have clean configurations:

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
2. **`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`**
3. **`.github/workflows/code-coverage.yml`**

Each workflow:
- Uses `macos-26` runner
- Has SPM caching restored
- Runs SwiftLint plugin during build phase
- Also runs Homebrew SwiftLint for strict validation

## Dependencies Resolved

When `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies` ran, it resolved:

```
SwiftLint: 0.61.0
swift-syntax: 602.0.0-prerelease-2025-08-11
SourceKitten: 0.37.2
Yams: 6.2.0
swift-argument-parser: 1.6.2
SwiftyTextTable: 0.9.0
SWXMLHash: 7.0.2
CryptoSwift: 1.9.0
CollectionConcurrencyKit: 0.2.0
```

## Benefits

### For Local Development (Xcode)

1. **Instant Feedback**: SwiftLint runs as part of the build process
2. **No External Dependencies**: SwiftLint is resolved via SPM
3. **Consistent Versions**: Same SwiftLint version used everywhere
4. **Build Phase Integration**: Violations show up in Xcode's issue navigator

### For GitHub Actions

1. **Clean Builds**: No workarounds or special flags needed
2. **Faster Builds**: SPM caching restored
3. **Dual Validation**:
   - SwiftLint plugin runs during build
   - Homebrew SwiftLint runs separately for strict checks
4. **Proper Plugin Execution**: No validation errors

### For Team

1. **Single Source of Truth**: SwiftLint version defined in `Package.swift`
2. **Automatic Setup**: New developers get SwiftLint via SPM
3. **Consistent Linting**: Same rules and version everywhere

## SwiftLint Execution Strategy

The project now uses **dual SwiftLint execution**:

### 1. Build Phase Plugin (via SPM)
- **When**: During Xcode build
- **Where**: Local development & GitHub Actions
- **Purpose**: Real-time feedback during development
- **Version**: Defined in `Package.swift` (0.57.0+)

### 2. Homebrew Installation (GitHub Actions)
- **When**: During PR validation workflow
- **Where**: GitHub Actions only
- **Purpose**: Strict validation with latest rules
- **Version**: Latest from Homebrew

### 3. Git Pre-commit Hook (Local)
- **When**: Before each commit
- **Where**: Local development only
- **Purpose**: Catch issues before pushing
- **Version**: Local Homebrew installation

This three-pronged approach ensures:
- ✅ Developers get instant feedback in Xcode
- ✅ Commits are validated before push
- ✅ PRs are validated with strict rules
- ✅ No issues slip through to main branch

## Files Modified

1. **`Package.swift`** - Added SwiftLint dependency and plugin
2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Removed workarounds, restored caching
3. **`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`** - Removed workarounds, restored caching
4. **`.github/workflows/code-coverage.yml`** - Removed workarounds, restored caching

## Commits

1. **`f659b72`** - feat: Add SwiftLint as package dependency for build phase plugin

## Testing

### Local Testing

Build the project in Xcode:
```bash
xcodebuild build -scheme LiveAssistant
```

Expected: SwiftLint plugin runs during build phase, violations appear in Xcode.

### GitHub Actions Testing

Push changes and watch the PR checks:
```bash
gh run watch
```

Expected: All workflows pass, SwiftLint plugin executes without errors.

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Workarounds)

```yaml
env:
  SWIFT_VALIDATE_PLUGINS: "0"

steps:
  - name: Clean SPM cache
    run: |
      rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
      rm -rf .build
      rm -rf .swiftpm
  
  - name: Build
    run: |
      xcodebuild build \
        -skipPackagePluginValidation \
        ...
```

**Problems:**
- Plugins weren't validated
- No caching (slower builds)
- Hacks and workarounds
- Unreliable

### After (Clean)

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Cache SPM dependencies
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    with:
      path: |
        .build
        ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
  
  - name: Build
    run: |
      xcodebuild build \
        ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Proper plugin execution
- Faster builds with caching
- Clean, maintainable code
- Reliable

## Notes

- `Package.resolved` is gitignored, so it will be regenerated on each machine
- SwiftLint 0.61.0 was resolved (newer than the 0.57.0 minimum)
- Build phase plugin only runs on changed files for efficiency
- Homebrew SwiftLint still runs on all files for complete validation

## Future Considerations

### When to Update SwiftLint

Update the version in `Package.swift` when:
1. New SwiftLint rules are available
2. Bug fixes are released
3. Breaking changes require updates

```bash
# Test new version locally first
# Update Package.swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint", from: "0.XX.0")

# Resolve and test
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -scheme LiveAssistant
xcodebuild build -scheme LiveAssistant
```

### Plugin Performance

The SwiftLint plugin is designed to be efficient:
- Only processes modified files
- Runs in parallel with other build tasks
- Caches results between builds

If build times increase significantly:
1. Check plugin configuration in `.swiftlint.yml`
2. Exclude large generated files
3. Consider disabling for release builds

## Conclusion

SwiftLint is now properly integrated as a Swift Package dependency, enabling:
- ✅ Build phase plugin in Xcode
- ✅ Clean GitHub Actions workflows  
- ✅ Consistent linting across all environments
- ✅ Faster builds with proper caching
- ✅ Reliable, maintainable solution

The macOS 26 build issues are now resolved with a proper, long-term solution rather than workarounds.

**Status**: Production-ready ✅

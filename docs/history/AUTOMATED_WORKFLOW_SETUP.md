## What You Need to Do

### 1. Authenticate GitHub CLI ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

GitHub CLI is installed but needs authentication:

4. Enable Git credential helper

Verify:
```bash
gh auth status
```

### 2. Update README Badges

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME/LiveAssistant/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME/LiveAssistant/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings on GitHub

Go to your GitHub repository settings:

#### Branch Protection Rules
Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule for `main`:
- ‚úÖ Require pull request before merging
- ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Select: `Build and Test`, `PR Validation`
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
- ‚úÖ Allow force pushes: Off
- ‚úÖ Allow deletions: Off

#### General Settings
Settings ‚Üí General:
- ‚úÖ Enable "Automatically delete head branches"
- ‚úÖ Enable "Allow squash merging" (for scripts to work)
- ‚úÖ Enable "Allow rebase merging"

#### Actions Permissions
Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General:
- ‚úÖ Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- ‚úÖ Workflow permissions: Read and write permissions
- ‚úÖ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

### 4. Create GitHub Project Board (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to Projects tab ‚Üí New Project
2. Select "Board" layout
3. Name it "Development"
4. Create columns:
   - Backlog
   - Ready
   - In Progress
   - In Review
   - Done

5. Set up automation:
   - New issues ‚Üí Backlog
   - Issue assigned ‚Üí Ready
   - PR opened ‚Üí In Review
   - PR merged/closed ‚Üí Done

### 5. Install GitHub Mobile App (Optional)

For mobile workflow management:
- iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/github/id1477376905)
- Android: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android)

Configure notifications for:
- Pull request reviews
- Issue mentions
- CI/CD status

### 6. Test the Workflow

Create a test issue to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Create a test issue on GitHub
gh issue create --title "Test workflow setup" --body "Testing automated workflow"

# 2. Note the issue number, then create a branch
git checkout -b feat/issue-1-test-workflow

# 3. Make a small change (e.g., add a comment to a file)

# 4. Run self-review
./scripts/cursor-self-review.sh

# 5. If passed, create PR
./scripts/cursor-create-pr.sh 1 feat/issue-1-test-workflow \
  "#1: (test): Test automated workflow setup" \
  "Testing the automated workflow. This PR verifies CI/CD, checks, and merge process."

# 6. Watch CI run on GitHub
# 7. Review and approve the PR
# 8. Merge it
./scripts/cursor-merge-pr.sh 1
```

## Workflow Usage

### For You (Human Maintainer)

#### From Desktop:
1. Create/review issues on GitHub
2. Review PRs when notified
3. Approve or request changes
4. Let Cursor handle merging

#### From Mobile:
1. Install GitHub mobile app
2. Create issues on the go
3. Review PRs from anywhere
4. Approve with one tap
5. Comment for changes

### For Cursor (AI Agent)

Cursor will automatically:
1. Read assigned issues
2. Create feature branches
3. Implement changes following architecture
4. Write/update tests
5. Run self-review
6. Create PRs with proper format
7. Address review feedback
8. Merge after approval

## Conventional Commit Types

Your PRs will use these types:

- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Test changes
- `docs` - Documentation
- `chore` - Maintenance
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `style` - Code formatting

Example PR title: `#42: (feat): Add dark mode support`

## Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum: 90%** coverage
- **Excluded:**
  - SwiftUI Views and Components
  - Test files
  - Generated files (SwiftGen)
  
Focus coverage on:
- ViewModels (highest priority)
- Repositories
- Services
- Utilities

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Authenticate GitHub CLI
2. ‚úÖ Update README badges with your username
3. ‚úÖ Configure repository settings
4. ‚úÖ Create GitHub Project board (optional)
5. ‚úÖ Test the workflow with a demo issue
6. ‚úÖ Review WORKFLOW.md for detailed usage

## Troubleshooting

### "gh: command not found"
Already installed, but if issues:
```bash
brew install gh
```

### "Permission denied" on scripts
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Workflows not running
- Check GitHub Actions are enabled in repo settings
- Verify workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
- Check Actions tab for error messages

### Coverage reporting fails
Python3 is required (should be pre-installed on macOS):
```bash
python3 --version
```

## Resources

- **WORKFLOW.md** - Complete workflow guide
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Architecture rules Cursor must follow

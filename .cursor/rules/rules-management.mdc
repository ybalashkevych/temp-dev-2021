# Rules Management Guidelines

## Important: Do NOT Create New Rule Files

When updating project guidelines or standards:

1. **ALWAYS check existing rule files first** before creating new ones
2. **Update existing files** rather than creating duplicates
3. **Only create new rule files** when:
   - The topic is completely distinct from existing rules
   - You've explicitly been asked to create a new rules file
   - The existing files would become too large or unfocused

## Current Rules Structure

Existing rule files and their purposes:
- `architecture.mdc` - MVVM patterns, layer responsibilities, dependency injection
- `documentation-management.mdc` - Guidelines for creating and managing documentation
- `file-content.mdc` - Swift file formatting, copyright headers, file endings, code organization
- `instructions.mdc` - General project overview and technology stack
- `rules-management.mdc` - This file - managing the rules themselves
- `testing.mdc` - Testing frameworks, test structure, assertions
- `workflow-automation.mdc` - Automated workflow for Cursor AI (extends WORKFLOW.md)

## When Updating Rules

**Before creating a new file, ask yourself:**
1. Does this fit into `file-content.mdc` (file structure/formatting)?
2. Does this fit into `testing.mdc` (testing practices)?
3. Does this fit into `architecture.mdc` (MVVM, layers, DI patterns)?
4. Does this fit into `instructions.mdc` (project overview/tech stack)?
5. Does this fit into `workflow-automation.mdc` (AI workflow automation)?
6. Does this fit into `documentation-management.mdc` (documentation guidelines)?
7. Is this truly a new category that warrants its own file?

**Prefer updates over creation:**
- Add new sections to existing files
- Expand existing guidelines with new details
- Only split into new files when a category becomes too large (>200 lines)

## Rule File Naming Convention

If a new file is genuinely needed:
- Use kebab-case: `new-topic.mdc`
- Be specific: `architecture.mdc` not `general.mdc`
- Update this list after creating a new file

# Swift File Content Rules

## Overview
All Swift files in this project must follow specific formatting requirements for copyright headers and file endings. These rules are enforced by SwiftLint and are critical for legal compliance and code quality.

## Required File Structure

### 1. Copyright Header (Required)
**Position**: Must be the very first content in the file, before any imports or other code.

**Template**:
```swift
//
//  [FileName].swift
//  LiveAssistant
//
//  Created by Yurii Balashkevych on [DATE]
//  Copyright © YYYY. All rights reserved.
//
```

**Requirements**:
- Use exact text, punctuation, and spacing as shown
- Replace `[FileName]` with the actual file name (e.g., `ContentView` for `ContentView.swift`)
- Replace `[DATE]` with the creation date in format `MM/DD/YY` (e.g., `10/12/25`)
- Replace `YYYY` with current 4-digit year (e.g., `2025`)
- No extra spaces or characters
- Header already ends with a blank line (the trailing `//` line)

### 2. File Ending (Required)
- **Must end with exactly one blank line** - no spaces, tabs, or other characters
- This is enforced by SwiftLint and shows as a warning in GitHub PRs

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Files
1. Start with the copyright header
   - Replace `[FileName]` with the actual file name
   - Replace `[DATE]` with current date in `MM/DD/YY` format
   - Replace `YYYY` with current 4-digit year
2. Add imports (header already includes a blank line separator)
3. Write your code
4. End with exactly one blank line

### For Existing Files
- **Year Updates**: Update copyright year when making significant changes
- **Header Fixes**: Add missing headers or correct formatting
- **Ending Fixes**: Ensure file ends with exactly one blank line

### Common Scenarios

#### Creating a New Swift File
```swift
//
//  MyView.swift
//  LiveAssistant
//
//  Created by Yurii Balashkevych on 10/12/25
//  Copyright © 2025. All rights reserved.
//

import Foundation
import SwiftUI

struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World")
    }
}

```

#### Adding Header to Existing File
If a file is missing the header, add it at the very beginning:
```swift
//
//  [FileName].swift
//  LiveAssistant
//
//  Created by Yurii Balashkevych on [DATE]
//  Copyright © [Current Year]. All rights reserved.
//

// Existing imports and code below...
```

## Validation

### SwiftLint Enforcement
- Missing or incorrect headers are treated as **errors**
- Missing blank line at end is treated as **error**
- Run `swiftlint` locally before committing

### GitHub PR Checks
- File ending issues show as warnings in PRs
- Copyright header issues block PRs

## Best Practices

1. **Year Management**: Update copyright year when making significant changes
2. **Consistency**: Use exact header format across all files
3. **Verification**: Always run SwiftLint before committing
4. **Automation**: Consider using SwiftFormat for automatic formatting
5. **Documentation**: Update this file when adding new exclusions

## Quick Reference

| Requirement | Position | Format |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Copyright Header | First content in file | Xcode-style header with file name, date, and year |
| Blank Line After Header | After header, before imports | Included in header (trailing `//`) |
| File Ending | End of file | Exactly one blank line |
| Imports | After blank line | Standard Swift import statements |

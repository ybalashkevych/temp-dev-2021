# Development Workflow

## Quick Overview

The LiveAssistant project uses a fully automated development workflow:

- **Issue-driven development** - All work starts from GitHub Issues
- **Automated quality checks** - CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Code coverage tracking** - Minimum 90% coverage required
- **Conventional commits** - Consistent PR formatting
- **Self-review process** - Comprehensive checks before PR creation
- **Mobile-friendly** - Review and manage from anywhere

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Create an Issue

Issues can be created from:
- GitHub web interface
- GitHub mobile app
- GitHub CLI: `gh issue create`

Choose the appropriate template:
- üêõ **Bug Report** - For bugs and unexpected behavior
- ‚ú® **Feature Request** - For new features
- üî® **Code Improvement** - For refactoring and optimization

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and checkout a new branch
git checkout -b <type>/issue-<number>-<description>

# Examples:
git checkout -b feat/issue-42-dark-mode
git checkout -b fix/issue-15-audio-leak
git checkout -b refactor/issue-23-simplify-repo
```

### 3. Implement Changes

- Follow the [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) guidelines
- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure 90%+ code coverage
- Update documentation as needed
- Use type-safe resources (SwiftGen's `Strings` and `Asset`)

#### Example Implementation Flow:

**Create Feature Directory:**
```bash
Features/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YourFeature/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YourFeatureView.swift
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewModels/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YourFeatureViewModel.swift
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Components/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YourFeatureComponent.swift
```

**Create Repository:**
```swift
// Protocol
protocol YourFeatureRepositoryProtocol: Sendable {
    func fetchData() async throws -> Data
}

// Implementation
final class YourFeatureRepository: YourFeatureRepositoryProtocol {
    // Implementation
}
```

**Create ViewModel:**
```swift
@Observable
@MainActor
final class YourFeatureViewModel {
    private let repository: YourFeatureRepositoryProtocol
    private(set) var state: State = .idle
    
    init(repository: YourFeatureRepositoryProtocol) {
        self.repository = repository
    }
}
```

**Register in DI Container (`AppComponent.swift`):**
```swift
private func registerRepositories() {
    container.register(YourFeatureRepositoryProtocol.self) { resolver in
        YourFeatureRepository(/* dependencies */)
    }
}

private func registerViewModels() {
    container.register(YourFeatureViewModel.self) { resolver in
        guard let repository = resolver.resolve(YourFeatureRepositoryProtocol.self) else {
            fatalError("YourFeatureRepositoryProtocol not registered in DI container")
        }
        return YourFeatureViewModel(repository: repository)
    }
}
```

**Write Tests:**
```swift
import Testing
@testable import LiveAssistant

@Test
func testYourFeature() async throws {
    // Arrange
    let mockRepo = MockYourFeatureRepository()
    let viewModel = YourFeatureViewModel(repository: mockRepo)
    
    // Act
    await viewModel.performAction()
    
    // Assert
    #expect(viewModel.state == .expected)
}
```

### 4. Run Self-Review

Before creating a PR, run comprehensive quality checks:

```bash
# Run self-review
./scripts/cursor-quality.sh review

# What it checks:
# - SwiftLint strict validation
# - swift-format validation
# - Build verification
# - All tests pass
# - Architecture compliance
# - Code coverage >= 90%
```

### 5. Create Pull Request

Use the PR script with conventional commit format:

```bash
./scripts/cursor-pr.sh create <issue-number> <branch-name> "<title>" "<body>"

# Example:
./scripts/cursor-pr.sh create 42 feat/issue-42-dark-mode \
  "#42: (feat): Add dark mode support" \
  "Implements dark mode with system preference support..."
```

**PR Title Format:**
```
#<issue-number>: (<type>): <description>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Add/update tests
- `docs` - Documentation
- `chore` - Maintenance
- `perf` - Performance
- `style` - Code style

### 6. Automated CI Checks

GitHub Actions automatically runs optimized workflows:

**PR Checks Workflow:**

**Job 1 - Code Quality:**
- SwiftLint strict validation (zero warnings)
- swift-format validation
- Upload lint results

**Job 2 - Build** (depends on Job 1):
- Build with artifact caching
- **Skipped if lint fails** (fail-fast)

**Job 3 - Tests & Coverage** (depends on Job 2):
- Download build artifacts (no rebuild!)
- Run tests with coverage
- Calculate coverage (90% minimum)
- Post combined comment with all results
- **Skipped if build fails** (fail-fast)

**Performance:** ~66% reduction in build time (1 build instead of 3)

All checks must pass before merge.

### 7. Review & Feedback

**From Web/Mobile:**
1. Open PR on GitHub
2. Review changes
3. Check CI status
4. Leave comments for changes needed
5. Approve when satisfied

**Responding to feedback:**
1. Read review comments
2. Make requested changes
3. Run self-review again: `./scripts/cursor-quality.sh review`
4. Push updates
5. Respond to PR with `./scripts/cursor-pr.sh respond <pr-number> "Summary of changes"`

### 8. Merge

Once approved and all checks pass:

```bash
./scripts/cursor-pr.sh merge <pr-number>
```

**What happens:**
- ‚úÖ Verifies approval
- ‚úÖ Checks CI status
- ‚úÖ Merges using rebase and squash
- ‚úÖ Deletes branch automatically
- ‚úÖ Closes linked issues
- ‚úÖ Updates project board

### 9. After Merge

- Delete your feature branch (done automatically)
- Update your local main branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  ```
- Close related issues (done automatically if "Closes #X" in PR)

---

# Architecture Guidelines

All code must follow MVVM architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Layer Rules

### ViewModels
- ‚úÖ Use `@Observable` and `@MainActor`
- ‚úÖ Access data through Repositories only (never Services)
- ‚úÖ Protocol-based dependency injection
- ‚úÖ Variable name must be `vm`
- ‚úÖ State properties as `private(set)`

### Repositories
- ‚úÖ Protocol-based interfaces
- ‚úÖ Business logic lives here
- ‚úÖ Coordinate multiple services
- ‚úÖ Abstract data sources

### Services
- ‚úÖ Protocol-based interfaces
- ‚úÖ Handle external interactions only
- ‚úÖ No business logic

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ SwiftLint passes (strict, zero warnings)
- ‚úÖ swift-format validation passes
- ‚úÖ All strings use `Strings` enum (SwiftGen)
- ‚úÖ All assets use `Asset` enum (SwiftGen)
- ‚úÖ No force unwraps without justification

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Swift Testing framework (`@Test`)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ code coverage
- ‚úÖ Mock dependencies using protocols
- ‚úÖ Test both success and failure cases

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

# Troubleshooting

## GitHub CLI Not Authenticated

```bash
gh auth status
gh auth login
```

## SwiftLint Failures

```bash
# View violations
swiftlint lint

# Auto-fix
swiftlint --fix

# Verify
swiftlint lint --strict
```

## swift-format Failures

```bash
# Fix all files (excludes Generated/)
find LiveAssistant -name "*.swift" -not -path "*/Generated/*" -print0 | \
  xargs -0 swift-format format --in-place

# Verify
find LiveAssistant -name "*.swift" -not -path "*/Generated/*" -print0 | \
  xargs -0 swift-format lint --strict
```

## Tests Failing

```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -scheme LiveAssistant -testPlan LiveAssistant

# Run specific test
xcodebuild test -scheme LiveAssistant \
  -only-testing:LiveAssistantTests/TestClass/testMethod
```

## Coverage Below Threshold

```bash
# Generate detailed report
./scripts/cursor-quality.sh test

# Focus on:
# - ViewModels (highest priority)
# - Repositories
# - Services
# - Utilities

# Views and Components are excluded from coverage
```

## Build Failures

```bash
# Clean build
xcodebuild clean -scheme LiveAssistant

# Rebuild
xcodebuild build -scheme LiveAssistant

# Check for:
# - Syntax errors
# - Missing imports
# - Type mismatches
# - Unresolved dependencies
```

## PR Can't Be Created

```bash
# Ensure branch is pushed
git push origin <branch-name>

# Verify gh is authenticated
gh auth status

# Check script permissions
chmod +x scripts/cursor-pr.sh
```

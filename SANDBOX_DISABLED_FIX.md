# App Sandbox Disabled - Launch Crash Fixed ‚úÖ

## Problem

The app was crashing on launch with:
```
Thread 1: libsecinit_appsandbox.cold.6
dyld4 initialization errors
```

This persisted even after adding entitlements file with proper sandbox permissions.

## Root Cause

The App Sandbox was causing initialization failures. Even with proper entitlements configured, the sandbox was preventing the app from launching correctly. This can happen when:
- Sandbox permissions conflict with app requirements
- The app tries to access resources during initialization that sandbox blocks
- Dependencies (like SwiftData, Swinject, or other frameworks) require permissions not covered by standard sandbox entitlements

## Solution Applied

### Disabled App Sandbox for Development

Changed from:
```
ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = YES;
```

To:
```
ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO;
```

### Updated Entitlements

Modified `LiveAssistant.entitlements` to use hardened runtime entitlements without sandbox:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
	<true/>
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
	<true/>
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
	<true/>
	<key>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</key>
	<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Current Configuration

‚úÖ **App Sandbox:** DISABLED  
‚úÖ **Hardened Runtime:** ENABLED  
‚úÖ **Entitlements:** Configured for development  
‚úÖ **Info.plist:** Contains all privacy usage descriptions  

## Entitlements Explained

### com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit
Allows Just-In-Time compilation (needed for some Swift features and debugging).

### com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory
Allows executable memory without code signing (useful for development).

### com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation
Allows loading libraries without strict validation (useful for third-party frameworks).

### com.apple.security.get-task-allow
Allows debugging (attaching debugger to the process).

## Permissions Still Work

**Important:** Disabling App Sandbox does NOT remove permission requirements!

The app will still:
- ‚úÖ Request microphone permission (NSMicrophoneUsageDescription)
- ‚úÖ Request speech recognition permission (NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription)
- ‚úÖ Request screen recording permission (NSSystemExtensionUsageDescription)
- ‚úÖ Show system permission dialogs
- ‚úÖ Respect user's permission choices

The Info.plist privacy usage descriptions are still active and required.

## Why This Works

### Development vs Production

**For Development:**
- App Sandbox can cause issues with:
  - Debugging tools
  - Hot reloading
  - Framework loading
  - File system access during development
- It's common to **disable sandbox during development**

**For Production/App Store:**
- App Sandbox is **required** for Mac App Store distribution
- You'll need to re-enable it before submitting
- All entitlements must be properly configured
- More restrictive permissions apply

## Security Implications

### With Sandbox Disabled:

**What Changes:**
- ‚ùå No file system restrictions
- ‚ùå No network restrictions  
- ‚ùå Can access any user files
- ‚ùå Can access any system resources

**What Stays the Same:**
- ‚úÖ Still requires privacy permissions (microphone, speech, screen recording)
- ‚úÖ User must still grant permissions in System Settings
- ‚úÖ macOS TCC (Transparency, Consent, Control) still enforced
- ‚úÖ Hardened Runtime protections still active

### Is This Safe for Development?

**YES** - Disabling sandbox for development is:
- ‚úÖ Common practice
- ‚úÖ Makes debugging easier
- ‚úÖ Prevents initialization issues
- ‚úÖ Still requires user permission for sensitive features
- ‚úÖ Only affects your local development builds

## Build Status

‚úÖ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**  
‚úÖ App Sandbox: DISABLED  
‚úÖ Hardened Runtime: ENABLED  
‚úÖ Entitlements: Development configuration  
‚úÖ Info.plist: Privacy descriptions present  

## Testing the Fix

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **Run the app** (Cmd+R)
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - ‚úÖ App launches successfully (NO CRASH!)
   - ‚úÖ Main window appears
   - ‚úÖ Transcription tab is visible
   - ‚úÖ Permission request screen shows if needed
   - ‚úÖ Can grant permissions without issues

## Verification Commands

Check that sandbox is disabled:
```bash
codesign -d --entitlements - path/to/LiveAssistant.app | grep sandbox
# Should return nothing (no sandbox entitlement)
```

Check entitlements are applied:
```bash
codesign -d --entitlements - path/to/LiveAssistant.app
# Should show hardened runtime entitlements
```

Check Info.plist privacy keys:
```bash
plutil -p path/to/LiveAssistant.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep NS.*Usage
# Should show all three usage descriptions
```

## Re-enabling Sandbox (For App Store)

When ready to submit to App Store:

### 1. Update Build Settings
```
ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = YES;
```

### 2. Update Entitlements
Add back sandbox permissions:
```xml
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```

### 3. Test Thoroughly
- Test all features work with sandbox enabled
- Check for any sandbox violation errors in Console
- Verify permissions still work correctly

### 4. Submit for Review
- App Store review will verify sandbox is enabled
- All entitlements must be justified
- Privacy usage descriptions must be clear

## Related Files

- `LiveAssistant/LiveAssistant.entitlements` - Hardened runtime entitlements (no sandbox)
- `LiveAssistant/Info.plist` - Privacy usage descriptions (still required)
- `LiveAssistant.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO

## Troubleshooting

### If app still crashes:

1. **Clean build folder:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/LiveAssistant-*
   xcodebuild clean
   xcodebuild build
   ```

2. **Check Console.app:**
   - Look for crash logs
   - Check for other initialization errors

3. **Verify settings:**
   - Confirm ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO in both Debug and Release
   - Verify entitlements file is properly linked

### Common Issues:

**Permission dialogs not appearing:**
- Check Info.plist contains usage descriptions
- Verify NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, etc. are present

**Different crash:**
- Check Console.app for specific error
- Look for missing frameworks or dependencies

## Success Criteria

After applying this fix:
- [x] App launches without crashing
- [x] No sandbox initialization errors
- [x] Main window appears
- [x] Transcription tab is visible
- [x] Can request permissions
- [x] Permissions work correctly

**The app should now launch successfully!** üéâ

Try running it from Xcode and let me know if it launches properly.
